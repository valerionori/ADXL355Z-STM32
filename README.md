# ADXL355Z-STM32

The code is employed to read the EVAL-ADXL355Z acceleration data of the Z axis (X and Y axis reading can be readily enabled) on the STM32 NUCLEO-H755ZI-Q board. The accelerometer is connected to the NUCLEO board via the SPI protocol. A pinout diagram is available in the ADXL_TEST_H745ZI.ioc file.
